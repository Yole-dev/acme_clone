                        <p>Bob and Sheila, owner-operators of Paradise
                            Connections Yacht Charters, are experienced sailors whose goal is to assist you in finding t
                            best boat for your charter yacht sailing vacation.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="box2 black-box2">
                        <p>Bob grew up around boats in Southern California, while
                            Sheila's only boating experience was riding
                            a ferry a couple of times. We met,
                            got married and went to France in 1980. We lived on a p√©niche (French barge) for a few years
                            on
                            the Seine river outside of Paris.
                            This is where we got the boat-building bug.</p>

                    <div class="box2">
                        <p>After building a few dinghies and a kayak, we decided to tackle a large project -- a 26-foot
                            liveaboard sailboat. Within six months we were living
                            aboard Loose Moose on the Marne river east of Paris.</p>

                    <p>love love love... We are a bit different to other
                        charter yacht brokers. The crew of Paradise
                        Connections live in the Caribbean islands year
                        round aboard our personal sail boat. We keep in touch
                        with the boats and crews as they are our friends and neighbors.</p>
